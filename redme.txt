How to run a code:
1. Install two npm packages at the folder location: "web-developer-assessment-Level1"
	i) Express (npm install express)
	ii)Request (npm install request)
3. open cmd and set the execution path to the folder "web-developer-assessment-Level1".
4. Run the server by the command : node server.js (this will start server at 3000 port localhost);
Note: Server has been create due to CORS Error. Server to server call doesn't require cors and I created server which is cors enabled.
5. Now directly open the product_list_page.html file on browser.
